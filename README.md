To run the project: python manage.py runserver
to make use of the api:
1. localhost:8000/admin = to view the admin panel (username=adam password=1234) or create a new superuser
2. localhost:8000/api/posts = list the all post objects (get and post)
3. localhost:8000/api/posts/<int x> = retrieve/ delete the xth post
4. localhost:8000/api/posts/<int x>/vote = vote for the post x as well as delete the vote


Feel free to fork the project and use this api as well as use this in your frontend website/app.
Its my first rest api exposure.
Rest api take the project to a next level.
This projects is very handy.
